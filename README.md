## Installation

You can either install node and yarn on your machine locally to run this or you can use Docker. Either way, you'll need docker in order to supply the database.

#### Local

If you already have node (v12+) and yarn installed on your machine:

```bash
yarn install
```

Make sure there's a database to connect to:

```bash
docker-compose up db
```

In a seperate terminal tab or window, start the server:

```bash
yarn start
```

#### Docker

If you'd like to run a build of the app without having to install Node or any of
the project dependencies, you can do so using Docker.

First, make sure you have a `.env` file in the project root and ensure it has all the same environment variables that `.env.template` has. If you don't have this already you can run the
following command from the project root:

```bash
cp .env.template .env
```

Next, bring up the web and db docker containers and you're good to go.

```bash
docker-compose up
```

## Usage

I've included a [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) collection and environment in the `postman` directory at the root of the project that you can [import](https://learning.postman.com/docs/postman/collections/data-formats/#importing-postman-data) to easily get started testing out the different api endpoints.

I've added a bit of documentation to that as well so it should hopefully be pretty easy to find your way around the api endpoints.

#### Authentication

All endpoints excepts for `POST /auth/token` and `POST /users` require authentication via a Bearer JWT access token.

After you create the first user, you can obtain an access token by sending a POST request with your credentials to the `POST /auth/token` endpoint.

If you're using Postman, it will automatically store the access token from the response in a variable and attach it to all endpoints requiring it via an Authorization header.

## Test

Tests are a little light at the moment ðŸ™‰

```bash
# unit tests
yarn test

# e2e tests
yarn test:e2e

# test coverage
yarn test:cov
```
